                    Ride with the Wave is a Surf Project focused essentially on<br>the happiness and well-being of everyone!<br> 
                    This project was born out of a surf trip back in 2014 to SÃ£o Vicente,<br>one of the Cape Verde Islands, of 
                    the coast of Senegal in Africa.<br> 
                    A beautiful story about letting yourself go with the flow!<br>
                    Tania Laje is a certified surf instructor by the Portuguese Surf Federation.<br> 
                    After some years working as a free lancer surf instructor<br>she decided to start her own surf project.<br>Living 
                    abroad between Portugal and the Canary Islands<br>where she kept developing her work with surf lessons<br> 
                    surf therapy and adapted surfing, giving more growth and knowledge to the project<br>until she decided to 
                    go back to the Azores in 2018, and promote her surf<br>lessons on the island where she was born.
